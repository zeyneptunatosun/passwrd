# Password Checker

This is a simple Java application that continuously prompts the user to enter a password until the correct one is entered. The program uses a `do-while` loop to ensure that the user is asked for the password at least once and will continue to prompt for the correct password if the initial input is incorrect.

## Features
- Prompts the user for a password.
- If the password is incorrect, it will inform the user and ask for the password again.
- Once the correct password is entered, it prints a success message.
